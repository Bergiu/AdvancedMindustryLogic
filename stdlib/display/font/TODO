- check if `@counter = @counter + (... * 2)` still works after compiler update
- add prefix to variable names
- move segment_display_14 into a separate file
- `exec segment_display_14(0b000110000111111)` prints a 0. maybe i can add something to the compiler that makes this easier. For example this: `#define w0 exec segment_display_14(0b000110000111111)` will replace every line with w0 with the exec statement
