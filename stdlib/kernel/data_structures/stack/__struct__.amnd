struct MemStack(memcell, pos, capacity, length)
# [capacity, length, ..array]

# Stack
# A stack has a maximum size (capacity) but also a length.
# If you add new items to it the length increases. If you add more
# than the capacity it gives an error.
# You can only add new items on the top and remove one from top.
# Metadata is saved in the processor, so it can't be used for
# multiprocessing.
